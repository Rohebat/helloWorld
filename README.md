# helloWorld
repo following the Github "Hello World" introductory guide

I am a first year CS student at the University of Lincoln. I am 21 years old and working on my first "proper" GitHub repo as a groupwork project for this course. Before starting on the repo, I am familiarizing myself with Git and GitHub so that I will be leaving proper notes throughout the project so we can write a sufficient report on our version control and give a good presentation on how we worked together for the project.
